## Unemployment Visualization Web Application
A Web application to anaylize the the US Unemployment rates over the date ranges from 1978 to the current month.

## Sources
The application uses the seasonally not adusted state wide unemployment rates from the [BLS Website](http://www.bls.gov/). For map, it  uses the US Shape JSON file from the [Census IRE Website](http://census.ire.org/)

## How it works?

Application mainly divided into two menus
- States _vs_ Time Range
- Different States _vs_ Different Years

### States _vs_ Time Range

By default, the application shows the National Unemployment rate through line graph that distributed from the 1976 to 2011. It has the check box option to select/deselect the National Unemployment from the graph.

Using the Map, we can select/deselect the particular state to plot its respective employment rate to the Graph Area.
The selected states in the map and graph can be distinguised with the automatically associated colors.

Required data range can be set using the provided slider. The line graphs are automatically replotted as per the new  selected data range.
